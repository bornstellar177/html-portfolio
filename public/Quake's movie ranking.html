<h2>Last 3 movies I watched</h2>
<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
<p>A brief concise history on nuclear race during the world war</p>
<h3>Deadpool and Wolverine</h3>
<p>Action packed yet dull writing of the villain.Nostalgic stuff are all over the movie.</p>
<h3>Morbius</h3>
<p>This is seriously one of the movies that is ever made</p>
